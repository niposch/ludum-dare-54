	"game_over": "To our traveling troublemaker,\n\nEVICTION NOTICE\n\nIt seems like you could not satisfy the quality standards that our [s]livestock[/s] precious sheep require for optimal wool growth and population expansion.\n\nYour measly [b]%d[/b] story building is dwarfed by structures like our Shears-Tower, and could only accommodate a total of [b]%d[/b] animals.\n\nWe expected better, and the council has decided to sever it's [s]yarn[/s] ties with you.\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn"
