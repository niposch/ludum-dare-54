	"start": "Dear travelling wizard,\n\nWe welcome you to our Wool Industry City as the first intelligent member of the sheep species.\n\nNothing stands in the way of your desire for woolly living space - apart from the neighbouring buildings of the Spinning Mill Syndicate and the \"Yarntastic\" Conglomerate.\n\nWe ask that you use your skills to meet the growing need for close-knit and species-appropriate shelter for your fellow sheep.\n\nOur hopes (and your visa) rest on your shoulders.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"first_warning": "Hello to our Woolly Wizard,\n\nwe love your carefully constructed cabins, yet we could not help but notice a bothersome predicament:\n\nPlease ensure to make sufficient space for the arriving array of additional sheep. We trust you will accommodate our arrangement.\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"second_warning": "Dear wizard,\n\nwith heavy hearts we heard of herds of homeless, helpless sheep.\n\nWe would advise our woolly wizard to take it up a notch - all the way up, in fact.\n\nConsider this consultation carefully, as our cooperation could conclude if worse comes to worst.\n\nWith a warning word to the wise,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"game_over": "To our traveling troublemaker,\n\nEVICTION NOTICE\n\nIt seems like you could not satisfy the quality standards that our [s]livestock[/s] precious sheep require for optimal wool growth and population expansion.\n\nYour measly [b]%d[/b] story building is dwarfed by structures like our Shears-Tower, and could only accommodate a total of [b]%d[/b] animals.\n\nWe expected better, and the council has decided to sever it's [s]yarn[/s] ties with you.\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn"
